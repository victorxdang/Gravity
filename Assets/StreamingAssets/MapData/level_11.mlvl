# Use the hashtag symbol to add comments or to comment out lines.
# Only lines within the <start><end> block will be parsed.
# Do not add comments within the <start><end> block, lines
# can be commented out but do add more than 7 lines within the
# <start><end> block.
#
# Any blocks after "F" is just a buffer zone for the camera so
# it doesn't look like the map just abruptly ends.
#
# P = Player
# C = Cube/Platform
# T = Triangle/Spike
# O = Falling obstacles (will spawn within the block so in the notepad, 
#     place it below the line that it will spawn on)
# F = Finish Flag
